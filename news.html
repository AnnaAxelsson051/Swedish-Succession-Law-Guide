  <h2 class="news-article-heading">An emerging change in swedish testament law</h2>
  <h3>New precedent, Danish lawchange and advancement of technology may lead to a re interpretation of 
    the formal requirements for holographic emergency wills
  </h3>
  <p>
    The formal requirement for writing a holographic emergency will has been the same since the 
    introduction of the Old Testament Act in 1930. Chapter 10 3 § of the Inheritance code states 
    that a testament to have validity shall consist of a document written and signed by the testator 
    by his own hand. Since the formal requirement was first introduced extensive technical development 
    has taken place which has contributed to significant changes in the way people communicate and the 
    way in which documents are produced. In recent decades a number of reforms have been implemented in 
    Swedish law with the aim of making it easier for people to take legal action in the digital 
    environment. This has resulted in the effectivization of a number of societal functions within,
     amongst others, the administration and the judiciary. As a result, for every family law lawyer 
     who has read up on practice from recent years, the question arises whether adaptation of the 
     formal requirement to the advancement of technology can extend all the way to the law of wills. 
     Few have not noticed the important case decided by the Court of Appeal in 2013, Mål nr T 11306-12,
      where the question was whether a testament that had been written by text message could be found 
      to constitute a valid holographic emergency will. Despite the fact that the document did not meet 
      the formal requirement in its traditional interpretation, and did not contain the testator’s 
      signature. In the case, however, it was undisputed that the will had been written by the testator. 
      The court came to the conclusion with the help of an interpretation of purpose that the will, 
      despite the fact that it had been written digitally, was to be regarded as handwritten and thus 
      in this regard could be considered to meet the formal requirement. The interpretation of the 
      meaning of the formal requirement was considered justified in light of the societal changes 
      that have taken place since the law was introduced. However, the will was found to be invalid 
      in view of the fact that it did not contain the testator’s signature. With the ruling, the 
      court can be said to have gone halfway to approving an electronically written holographic 
      emergency will, Current legislation, however, prevents the approval of this form of will.
In the light of the above, the question arises as to what formal framework should exist today for 
the freedom of testation, regarding holographic emergency wills. The testator’s right to decide how 
his belongings should be distributed after his death, as a part of the principle of ownership, is 
fundamental. At the same time, there is a risk of eroding the reliability of wills and legal
 uncertainty in the event that the establishment of wills is not regulated. with a sufficiently 
 strict requirement for a certain form. Most Swedish lawyers probably have a great deal of 
 hesitation as freedom of form or technical solutions are mentioned in the same sense as the 
 preparation of a will. At the same time this is exactly what has happened under Danish law, 
 where since 2008 the formal requirement for a holographic emergency will has been completely 
 abolished. The question for Swedish law is perhaps not about such a radical reform. However, 
 in the light of the 2013 Court of Appeal decision, the question arises for Swedish law which 
 interpretation that should be given to the formal requirement in the future. As well as what 
 possibilities exist to approve a will that has been written with the help of a technical device. 
 In addition, the question arises as to what, if any, legislative changes are required in order 
 to give the testator’s will sufficient opportunities for impact as technological development 
 progresses further and thus constitutes an increasing part of human every day life. The crucial 
 question before any reinterpretation or amendment of the law is whether the present formal 
 requirements can be considered reasonable in the light of the purposes on which this is based 
 and in the light of the technical development that has taken place during recent decades.
